the game has a loop that runs every frame.
Every frame, you draw everything as the data tells it

an object has a position
if in motion, you can move the position according to the speed
    speed would be pixels per frame
    in one frame, how many pixels should this move
But then you also have acceleration
    acceleration would change the speed each frame
    how much faster or slower should the speed be after one frame

The browser hopefully has a fixed frame rate, likely 0 frames per second.
