THE PURPOSE

I want to test not just making a game but making interfaces and managing screens.

For interfaces, I'm thinking of making components similar to Vue.

Like a button. It would have a certain style decided by the theme of the game. But it would have props for the text, specific color, and maybe position.

For position, I'm wondering if I have to implement a layout system. But I'll see.


THE GAME

I dunno.
- Weird ping pong? (ping pong with weird physics)
- Jepoardy (lots of text based stuff and screen management)
- Jackbox style game
- Pokemon style game
- Metroid style game
- Mario style game
- Something else.

Let's not get caught up here.
I just want to test out interfaces.
Let's start simple and build up.


ANIMATIONS

It would be nice to fade out and fade in at the very least.
Crossfade would be cool.

THE INTERFACES

Intro screen (video, interruptable by pressing any key)
    <fade to black>
    <fade in>
Title screen
    Full screen image
    1 button "Press Start (any key)"
    <crossfade>
Game Select
    3 options [new game, continue, options]
    - new game starts the game
    - continue is disabled
    - options opens Options Screen
Options Screen
    Music on/off
    Music volume (number)
    Sound Effects on/off
    Sound Effects volume (number)
    2 buttons []
    - Reset to Default
    - Go back

Game Screen
- Layer with health, points
- Pause brings pause menu (pauses all animation and updating)
    - Overlay with 3 buttons
        - continue
        - Options
        - Exit
            - Are you sure you want to exit? [yes, cancel]
Mario style game, collect coins and stuff.
Side scroll.
