This is a library of files that contain objects and methods and patterns that can be used for game dev.

It should not contain actual game logic, but customizable and reusable components, as well as notes, that can help in getting to the building process quicker, rather than reinventing the wheel each time.

It must be used as a git submodule. It will be versioned so that if multiple projects use it, they can checkout the commit they developed against and not break unless a migration is done manually.
